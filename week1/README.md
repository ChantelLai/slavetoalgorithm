## In Class Activity - Understanding Algorithms (Group 3)

In this algorithm, we wanted to create six different categories based on different things. The first was numbers, then followed by textures, direction, colours, animals, and (ugly or debatable) typefaces. It was all completely random and I guess in our heads it seemed more picturesque than the outcomes. We were working towards a final, random canvas artwork.

So, we would roll the dice six times and collect these data to form an artwork. In total, we did three whole rounds to create three drawings each. All of us had similar elements for each round, but because we all drew our own individual artwork, our outcomes slightly differed.

Through this exercise, it was definitely easier to understand how generative design / algorithms work. By setting ‘parameters’ or structured rules of some sort, these artworks could be randomly generated according to the rules. Of course, I would hope for the computer generated outcomes to be much better than my drawings. Although, I have realised that generative design doesn’t have to be computer generated as well.

Through looking at other group’s processes, it was interesting to see how different their artworks were. One group did heads & faces and another did drawings with different parts of their bodies. It was interesting to see how generative design can be used under many different circumstances, as long as you have a goal and set of rules.
