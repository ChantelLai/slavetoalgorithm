## 12 Hour Challenge

Before our class, we were given a task to create an algorithm that will help or challenge the rhythm of our daily tasks. 
And for this, I have chosen to include an algorithm in the way I select my music.

So with this algorithm, I was able to roll a dice and let the algorithm pick a music streaming site, genre, playlist, & even decide the amount of skips I am allowed to have if I didn't like the song. It was a really interesting process and I felt like I could have extended it to other parts of my day. For instance, time of day where I will listen to music, or the amount of time I would have to listen to the chosen playlist or maybe even to whether I would have to listen to music on that particular day. It was an interesting experience for me and I felt as if using an algorithm could really help with decision based processes especially if you are an indecisive person.

As for the outcome, I ended up listening to classical tunes on iHeart Radio.

## In Class Activity

In this class, we learnt how to code basic shapes and trigger some form of interaction in Processing. Learning how to code basic shapes was fine, but learning how to work out the maths for certain animation is somewhat tricky. In this activity, we used what we learned in class to creat a self portrait through Processing. 

Attached below is my self portrait. I coded this so that there would be a background change whenever you move your cursor. The task itself made me learn how to code  different shapes like an arc and a triangle, which was really interesting to figure/ understand how every shape has a different parameter.

I then remixed Yasmin's static portrait so that there would be a background change, and that the flowers will rotate whenever the cursor moves as well. It was super interesting to figure out how to make sure the three flower rotations would stay in their respective places. I then found out the resetMatrix(); function, which resets each translation, so it would be possible to do multiple translations and rotations which I thought was really enlightening.
