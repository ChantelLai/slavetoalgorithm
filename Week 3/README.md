## In Class Activity

In today's class, we were challenged to create a non-human machine in an hour. I had a few ideas at the back of my mind and tried to think of tools in my home which I could use to create some form of movement.
These were the two main ideas I decided to try within the hour.

With the first idea, I thought of using a cupboard door to create multiple strokes (by opening and closing the door) with a nail polish that I would attach with a string. However, the cupboards I had were either too tall or too low to work with and so, I decided to use a drawer in the kitchen which was perfect to work with. First, I attached the nail polish to a string and strengthened the grip with a tape. I then taped the nail polish to the top drawer and taped paper to the bottom drawer as a canvas. To create those strokes, I had to open and close the drawer multiple times.

I thought the outcome was really pretty! This reminds me of a traditional brush stroke painting. I thought it was really interesting as to how we could create these paintings by integrating movements from other tools, right in our home as well.

With the second idea, I thought of using a hand mixer to create circular movements by attaching a Sharpie to the mixer. My initial plan was to place the paper in a bowl, but I then decided not to, just to explore the mulitple opportunities that could happen if I had a bigger surface. So initially, I tied two Sharpies to the mixer but the other colour fell out when I started the machine. In a matter of a few seconds, the orange Sharpie however created this splash effect that spreaded all over my countertop. I really liked the outcome of the artwork as it wasn't expected at all. The splash effect created this detailed, abstract artwork, which was really nice to see close-up.

This is the close-up from a part of the artwork created. I really loved the details and thought about how time efficient it was to create those details.
